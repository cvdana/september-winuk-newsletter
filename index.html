            <span class="hello">HELLO WINUK COMMUNITY,</span><br /><br />
            As summer comes to an end and we go back to our routines, September
            reminds us of what we have left on pause and motivates us to strive
            for the better.<br />
            In September, we raise particular awareness on Alzheimer’s disease
            and challenge the stigma around dementia. Memory loss is not part of
            normal ageing and a diagnosis of dementia profoundly affects the
            patient and their loved ones. However, even if a memory could have a
            short retention for affected patients, the feelings associated with
            it remain deeply imprinted. At WiNUK we support research on dementia
            and Alzheimer through events, blogs and social advertisements aimed
            at raising awareness and facilitating collaborative research in the
            field.

                  Pain Awareness Month takes place every September to raise
                  awareness about issues related to chronic pain and pain

                  It aims to educate the public and healthcare professionals
                  about the challenges faced by people living with chronic pain
                  and the importance of finding effective treatments and
                  support.
                </p>
